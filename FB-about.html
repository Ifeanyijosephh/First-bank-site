                    <blockquote>
                        First Bank of Nigeria was established in 1984 by sir Alfred Jones, a shipping magnete form Liverpool, England. It was originally named Bank of British West Africa (BBWA)
                        and was the first bank in Nigeria, making it the oldest.
                        <br><br>
                            Today, First Bank is one of the largest and most respected banks in Africa, with strong presence in several countries and millions of customers. It is known for its legacy 
                            of trust, financial stability, and innovation in the banking industry.
                        <br><br>
                            In 1957, it changed its name to <strong> Bank of West Africa,</strong> and after Nigeria gained independence, the bank began increasing Nigerian participation in its ownership
                            and management. It became <strong> First Bank of Nigeria Limited in 1979</strong>, and later <strong> First Bank of Nigeria Plc</strong> in 1991.
